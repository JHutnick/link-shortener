This is my simple URL Shortener which is based on the principle of converting to base 62 and then redirecting the user to the original URL.

Installation:
pip install git+https://github.ccs.neu.edu/jhutnick10/url-shortener.git
Make sure Flask is installed: pip install Flask

How to run:
Upon installation run the app.py and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or localhost in your browser.
This will direct you to the html file which will take in any website starting with https://
If you run into any issues please make sure https:// is infront of any WWW address
